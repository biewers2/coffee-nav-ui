Overall the ambience is little loud, wouldn't come to study . A good amount of indoor seating and some outdoor seating ( not heated).\n\nThe parking lot by the building is private, probably owned by the apartments nearby.  Street parking was relatively easy to find.\n\nThe breakfast sandwich on a muffin was fairly good. The muffin bread was a little dense. The  almond croissant could have been more flakey.  The drinks were less sweet than Starbucks .
