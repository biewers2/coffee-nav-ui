There were only 2 people in front of me in line and the service was quick. I got one of their specialty drinks - the cardamom honey latte and I absolutely loved it!! Giving the spot 4 stars instead of 5, because I also ordered the Mediterranean avocado toast and I thought it was very average 3/5. The barista also didn’t ask if my order is for here or two go, so I ended up having to eat my toast from a box even though I was staying at the coffee shop for a bit. Overall, I liked the vibe and atmosphere and will be back to try their other specialty drinks!","time":1686842554.000000000},{"aspects":null,"authorName":"Riley Shepard","authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113318617420039255336/reviews","language":"en","profilePhotoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIdJliM0YViIfBmajdvZDP4GLVC7TQcFs5OH6O7EHtK=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":2,"relativeTimeDescription":"9 months ago","text":"I had a really disappointing experience at colectivo. I’ve ordered coffee from these guys online and had good beans. In the cafe I found bad coffee, super loud music, and poor customer service.\n\n2 stars because my cookie was excellent.\n\nThe baristas didn’t seem familiar with their offerings (one of them was training, but the person leading the training was more confused than the trainee). The shot they pulled was pretty astringent and they put my order to stay in a paper cup. Clearly they’re doing something right to be as successful as they are, but I wouldn’t recommend their coffee.\n\nI try not to leave a bad review of a coffee shop, but I really feel these sorts of issues hurt the industry and I’m hoping the consistency can get corrected.","time":1676382899.000000000},{"aspects":null,"authorName":"Gregory Stewart II","authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114074941840172550337/reviews","language":"en","profilePhotoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX1nN-99PXZ7EcI7D1J1ev22fQGyIHXxhV9lHrMDa93QtWT=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relativeTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":"NITRO POWER!!!!

I was trying to get an americano with the peppermint fluff but it couldn’t be made with water, so I got oatmilk because I can’t have regular milk. Instead of the vanilla syrup, I asked for sugar free white chocolate and got charged for the change. Yikes! It was tasty but I will not buy it again\n\nIt’s a cozy environment, but the seating is a little uncomfortable.","time":1670424648.000000000}],"types":["CAFE","FOOD","STORE","POINT_OF_INTEREST","ESTABLISHMENT"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=879881440894418577","utcOffset":-360,"vicinity":"223 East Saint Paul Avenue, Milwaukee","website":"http://colectivocoffee.com/cafes/third-ward/","htmlAttributions":[],"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL"}
