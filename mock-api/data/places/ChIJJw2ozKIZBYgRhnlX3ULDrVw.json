Got a small Ice Vanilla Latte and a ham & cheese sandwich. The latte was bit stronger than what I’m used to but still good to drink. My sandwich was made fresh and nicely toasted. I thought it was sweet the owner even bought my food to the table I was sitting at. I was a little sad I misread the menu online and was hoping to order dumpling soup but I guess they do soup of the day type of deal. Overall, a cute café and I’ll definitely be back on a weekend to try out their waffle specials.","time":1554969058.000000000},{"aspects":null,"authorName":"Myles Johnson","authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115760025567456601410/reviews","language":"en","profilePhotoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW15s-MKibYViGpoZsInaP24ZkYhdFXzPrqROlKXtJpeCM6=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relativeTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":"Full of Beans was great!
