They had an amazing selection as well as a big open fireplace arena. It had a wonderful feel and artwork was great. It has everything needed from a cup of coffee, meeting space, learning lab, etc. It had a wonderful design with plenty of natural sunlight. It had a great array of merchandise and coffee you could purchase to take home. This should be a regular place for anyone to bring out of town guests. The staff is very friendly and the place was clean and plenty of seating.
