The barista was extremely helpful while we chose our drinks and food. We tried a savory scone-bacon, cheddar and jalapeño and it was absolutely delicious. I wish I could purchase bags of these scones. They also have a variety of muffins and brownies. I tried the almost ice cream drink - it is an espresso drink with cream, chocolate, caramel and malt powder. It was heavenly and lived up to its name, tasting like a malted milkshake. My partner and I agreed that we could drink 5 of them with no regrets. If you like mochas/chocolatey coffee drinks and are able to go while it’s on the seasonal menu that is the drink for you. My partner got a honey vanilla latte-it was wonderfully balanced-not too sweet so that you could still taste the coffee notes. Cute latte art of course. After our coffees we also wanted to purchase some coffee beans and the barista was extremely knowledgeable about the coffee they sold and was able to tell us what the beans would taste like when brewed, what his favorite style of brew was with the beans - absolutely amazing. The place is decorated very clean and modern - black leather chairs with gold legs, minimalistic design with hanging plants and floating shelves. You can sit at the bar on blue velvet stools and strike up a conversation with the baristas when it’s not busy. It’s very pretty and an overall great atmosphere. We will definitely be back!","time":1691855409.000000000},{"aspects":null,"authorName":"Faisal H.","authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115080244283598816010/reviews","language":"en","profilePhotoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXLPrrnLJzXKw-O9DOsZB0gWRIKZdTp7kmY0d6YTathNwp7=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relativeTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":"Was on my saved list for a while and finally got a chance to stop by and get an awesome cup of coffee from this gem of a place.
